                <p>
                    <strong> Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi </strong> (2 October 1869 – 30 January 1948) was an Indian activist who was
                    the leader of the Indian independence movement against British rule. Employing nonviolent civil disobedience,
                    Gandhi led India to independence and inspired movements for civil rights and freedom across the world.
                    The honorific Mahātmā —applied to him first in 1914 in South Africa—is now used worldwide. In India,
                    he is also called
                    <abbr title="Mahatma Gandhi"> Bapu </abbr> (Gujarati: endearment for father, papa) and
                    <abbr title="Mahatma Gandhi"> Gandhi ji </abbr>, and unofficially known as the Father of the Nation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Born and raised in a Hindu merchant caste family in coastal Gujarat, India, and trained in law at the Inner Temple, London,
                    Gandhi first employed nonviolent civil disobedience as an expatriate lawyer in South Africa, in the resident
                    Indian community's struggle for civil rights. After his return to India in 1915, he set about organising
                    peasants, farmers, and urban labourers to protest against excessive land-tax and discrimination. Assuming
                    leadership of the Indian National Congress in 1921, Gandhi led nationwide campaigns for various social
                    causes and for achieving Swaraj or self-rule.

                    Gandhi famously led Indians in challenging the British-imposed salt tax with the 400 km (250 mi) Dandi Salt March in 1930,
                    and later in calling for the British to Quit India in 1942. He was imprisoned for many years, upon many
                    occasions, in both South Africa and India. He lived modestly in a self-sufficient residential community
                    and wore the traditional Indian dhoti and shawl, woven with yarn hand-spun on a charkha. He ate simple
                    vegetarian food, and also undertook long fasts as a means of both self-purification and political protest.

                    Gandhi's vision of an independent India based on religious pluralism, however, was challenged in the early 1940s by a new
                    Muslim nationalism which was demanding a separate Muslim homeland carved out of India. Eventually, in
                    August 1947, Britain granted independence, but the British Indian Empire was partitioned into two dominions,
                    a Hindu-majority India and Muslim-majority Pakistan. As many displaced Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs made
                    their way to their new lands, religious violence broke out, especially in the Punjab and Bengal. Eschewing
                    the official celebration of independence in Delhi, Gandhi visited the affected areas, attempting to provide
                    solace. In the months following, he undertook several fasts unto death to stop religious violence. The
                    last of these, undertaken on 12 January 1948 when he was 78, also had the indirect goal of pressuring
                    India to pay out some cash assets owed to Pakistan. Some Indians thought Gandhi was too accommodating.
                    Among them was Nathuram Godse, a Hindu nationalist, who assassinated Gandhi on 30 January 1948 by firing
                    three bullets into his chest. Captured along with many of his co-conspirators and collaborators, Godse
                    and his co-conspirator Narayan Apte were tried, convicted and executed while many of their other accomplices
                    were given prison sentences.

                    Gandhi's birthday, 2 October, is commemorated in India as Gandhi Jayanti, a national holiday, and worldwide as the International
                    Day of Nonviolence.

                        I believe that Gandhi’s views were the most enlightened of all the political men in our time.We should strive to do things
                        in his spirit: not to use violence in fighting for our cause, but by non-participation in anything
                        you believe is evil.
